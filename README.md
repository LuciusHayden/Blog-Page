# Blog page

This is a simple Blog page which isnt meant to be used for anything real. It was the epitomy of my use of Flask (I wont be using it anymore). It was also my main practice with HTML and CSS. I made this project for a project in the 100 days of code given by replit, its a little wonky because I had to port it over from replit, the project was inspired by the project of the day for 100 days of code, however its not the same.

# Author

Hello, my name is Lucius. This was a pretty cool project to make with HTML and CSS as making websites is quite interesting when you see all the changes being made in real time. This isnt going to gain any more features and I welcome you to do whatever with it when changing the text or something else. I have a youtube channel if you want to see some of my other projects which dont contain website dev.

# Features

- A homepage containing links to all the different posts
- A template page to make it easy to make more posts on new pages only requiring minimal changes

# lessons learned

I learned how to use Flask (which in reality told me I didnt want to do any more Flask) and I learned basic HTML and CSS which can probably come in handly later on in the future.

# Flask
You need flask for this code to work so if you plan on using this program your going to need to install it. Your also going to need a virtual enviroment and everything else associated with working with Flask.
